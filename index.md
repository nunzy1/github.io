# Introduction

The ownCloud platform is a flexible and durable open source file synchronization and sharing solution.  The solution includes:

 - ownCloud server, which runs on Linux.
 - Client applications for Microsoft Windows, Max OS X, and Linux.
 - Mobile clients for the Android and Apple iOS operating systems.

This appendix includes specific QuickStart procedures for ownCloud server.  For more information on ownCloud, refer to the [complete documentation set](https://doc.owncloud.com).

## Installing an ownCloud Server with Docker


**Important:** Ensure that you have met the server system requirements, which are documented in the core documentation under [Officially Recommended & Supported Options](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/admin_manual/installation/system_requirements.html).  The section documents [server options](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/admin_manual/installation/system_requirements.html#server) (versions), which ownCloud can add to or change with new releases. The section also provides important notes, deprecations, and [server memory](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/admin_manual/installation/system_requirements.html#memory-requirements) and [database](https://doc.owncloud.com/server/admin_manual/installation/system_requirements.html#database-requirements) requirements.

**Note:** Samples in the procedures that follow are representative.

Perform the following steps.


### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Header 4

###### Header 6

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
